This legal disclaimer ("Disclaimer") applies to all individuals who are editing the NICU Spoon software (the "Software"). Please carefully read and understand the following terms and conditions:

  1.	Purpose of the Software: The Software is intended solely for editing purposes and does not guarantee or certify the safety, suitability, or compliance of any physical product, including the NICU Spoon (the "Spoon"), produced using the Software.
  2.	Safety Certification: It is explicitly stated that the Spoon, if produced through any form of 3D printing or manufacturing process that does not comply with applicable food safety standards, is NOT SUITABLE OR SAFE for use with NICU infants or any other individuals requiring special dietary considerations.
  3.	Recommended Production Approach: The best way to produce the Spoon is by engaging a professional FDA Food Grade approved molding company, which has the expertise and capability to ensure compliance with food safety regulations. It is highly recommended to follow such a production approach to guarantee the safety and suitability of the Spoon for its intended purpose.
  4.	Concerns Regarding 3D Printing: It has been demonstrated in scientific studies that 3D printing is not considered a food-safe manufacturing method due to various factors such as material porosity and difficulty in achieving thorough cleaning and sanitization. For further information, please refer to the following publications:
    •	"Guide to Food-Safe 3D Printing"
    •	"Assessing Food Safety of 3D-Printed Parts in Fused Deposition Modeling"
  5.	Responsibility of Software Users: The individuals editing the Software bear full responsibility for ensuring that any Spoon produced using the Software adheres to applicable food safety regulations and quality control measures. It is their duty to validate and verify the suitability of the production process, materials, and final product to meet the required standards.
  6.	Limitation of Liability: The creators, authors, and copyright holders of the Software, including [Matthew Thomas Ketas], shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from the production, distribution, or use of the Spoon, including but not limited to any health issues or harm caused to NICU infants or any other individuals due to the use of an improperly produced Spoon.
     
By continuing to edit the Software or engaging in any activities related to the production or use of the Spoon, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms and conditions outlined in this Disclaimer.

Consultation with Experts: It is highly recommended that you consult with relevant experts, professionals, or regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with all applicable food safety standards and guidelines, such as the FDA Food Grade requirements and scientific studies on the limitations of 3D printing for food safety, before producing or utilizing the Spoon.
